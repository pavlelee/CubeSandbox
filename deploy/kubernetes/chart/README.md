# CubeSandbox Kubernetes/TKE Helm Chart

This chart delivers CubeSandbox on Kubernetes/TKE as chart-managed resources.
It follows the final Big Pod delivery design:

- bootstrap images are separate from runtime images;
- `cube-node` is a DaemonSet Big Pod;
- control-plane and compute/data-plane scheduling are separated through `placement.controlPlane` and `placement.compute`;
- PVM host kernel installation and host reboot are handled by a dedicated Init Container;
- Cube Node host preparation is handled by a second Init Container;
- MySQL schema migration is handled by CubeMaster itself using embedded migrations;
- Cube Master, Cube API, cubemastercli, Cube Proxy Node, WebUI, Template Builder, and Cube Node use separate images.

## Image responsibilities

| Image | Role |
|---|---|
| `cube-pvm-host-bootstrap` | Init Container only. Installs/configures PVM host kernel and may reboot the node. |
| `cube-node-init` | Init Container only. Loads KVM module, prepares host paths, validates `/dev/kvm` and XFS. |
| `cube-node` | Runtime container only. Runs `cubelet` and `network-agent`. |
| `cube-master` | Control-plane master only. Built from `CubeMaster/docker/Dockerfile`; runs `cubemaster`; schema migrations are embedded in the binary. |
| `cube-api` | HTTP API only. Runs `cube-api`. |
| `cubemastercli` | Operational CLI only. Packages the real `CubeMaster/bin/cubemastercli` binary for exec-based operations. |
| `cube-proxy-node` | Data-plane proxy. Reuses `CubeProxy/Dockerfile` and runs as a chart-managed DaemonSet when `cubeProxy.enabled=true`. |
| `cube-egress` | CubeEgress transparent outbound proxy. Reuses `CubeEgress/Dockerfile` and runs as a Cube Node sidecar when `cubeEgress.enabled=true`. |
| `cube-egress-net` | Host network rule helper for CubeEgress TPROXY/ip-rule/sysctl setup. |
| `cube-webui` | One-click WebUI static assets and OpenResty runtime. |
| template builder sidecar | Optional template builder with `dockerd`/BuildKit. Uses `docker:27-dind` by default. |

## Node selection

The chart separates placement into dedicated control-plane nodes and compute
nodes. Control-plane Deployments use `placement.controlPlane`; `cube-node`,
`cube-proxy-node`, and `cube-dns` use `placement.compute`.

The chart refuses to render host-mutating compute components without
`placement.compute.nodeSelector`. This prevents PVM bootstrap and Cube runtime
setup from running on ordinary nodes. The default compute selector includes
`cube.tencent.com/allow-pvm-bootstrap=true` because the default profile
initializes the PVM host kernel and may reboot selected compute nodes.

Default placement values:

```yaml
global:
  timezone: Asia/Shanghai

storageClass:
  create: true
  name: cube-cbs-wffc
  provisioner: com.tencent.cloud.csi.cbs
  volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer

placement:
  controlPlane:
    nodeSelector:
      cube.tencent.com/role: control
      cube.tencent.com/cube-control: "true"
    tolerations:
      - key: cube.tencent.com/control
        operator: Equal
        value: "true"
        effect: NoSchedule

  compute:
    nodeSelector:
      cube.tencent.com/role: compute
      cube.tencent.com/cube-node: "true"
      cube.tencent.com/allow-pvm-bootstrap: "true"
    tolerations:
      - key: cube.tencent.com/compute
        operator: Equal
        value: "true"
        effect: NoSchedule
```

Recommended labels:

```bash
kubectl label node <control-node>   cube.tencent.com/role=control   cube.tencent.com/cube-control=true   --overwrite

kubectl taint node <control-node>   cube.tencent.com/control=true:NoSchedule   --overwrite

kubectl label node <compute-node>   cube.tencent.com/role=compute   cube.tencent.com/cube-node=true   cube.tencent.com/allow-pvm-bootstrap=true   --overwrite

kubectl taint node <compute-node>   cube.tencent.com/compute=true:NoSchedule   --overwrite
```

The chart does not label or taint nodes. The platform operator must prepare node labels and taints before installation.
All chart-managed Cube containers and init containers receive `TZ` from
`global.timezone`.

## Cubelet data path

`bootstrap.nodeInit.dataCubelet.loopback.enabled` defaults to `true` so the
chart can create and mount a loopback XFS image for `/data/cubelet` during
bootstrap. Production environments that pre-provision `/data/cubelet` as XFS
can set it to `false`.

## Cube Node one-click parity

`cube-node` mirrors the one-click runtime layout:

- runtime tools are available through `/usr/local/bin/containerd-shim-cube-rs`, `/usr/local/bin/cube-runtime`, `/usr/local/bin/cubecli`, and `/usr/local/bin/cubevsmapdump`;
- `cubeNode.pvmGuestKernel.enabled` defaults to `true` and controls the one-click `CUBE_PVM_ENABLE` behavior, selecting `cube-kernel-scf/vmlinux -> vmlinux-pvm` or `vmlinux-bm`;
- `cubeNode.network.autoDetectEthName=true` auto-detects the primary host NIC and patches Cubelet `eth_name`;
- `cubeNode.network.cidr` can patch Cubelet cubevs CIDR when the packaged default conflicts with the host network.

`bootstrap.pvmHostKernel.enabled` also defaults to `true`, so the PVM host
kernel bootstrap Init Container can install/configure the host kernel and
perform the configured coordinated reboot. The default
`bootstrap.pvmHostKernel.bootArgs` is `nopti pti=off` because the current
`kvm_pvm` module does not support host KPTI. `cube-node-init` performs the same
fail-fast style checks as one-click for memory, glibc, cgroup v2 cpu
controller, cubecow dependencies, KVM, XFS, and PVM consistency. It fails when
a host has `kvm_pvm` loaded but `cubeNode.pvmGuestKernel.enabled=false`, or
when `cubeNode.pvmGuestKernel.enabled=true` but the host has not booted a PVM
kernel with `kvm_pvm` loaded.

## Build and push images

```bash
PUSH=1 REGISTRY=<registry>/<namespace> IMAGE_TAG=v0.4.0 ./deploy/images/build-cube-images.sh
```

Cube-owned images default to `imagePullPolicy: Always` because this chart uses the release tag directly and environments are expected to pull the pushed image from the registry during deployment.

If the target registry requires authentication, create a Kubernetes
`kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` Secret in the release namespace and pass it to
the chart:

```yaml
imagePullSecrets:
  - name: <registry-pull-secret>
```

## Install

```bash
helm upgrade --install cube ./deploy/k8s/chart   -n cube-system   --create-namespace   -f <runtime-values.yaml>   --wait   --timeout 90m
```

> Do not store SSH passwords or node login credentials in this chart. Host mutation is performed through Kubernetes privileged Pods, not through SSH.

## Use third-party MySQL or Redis

The chart installs `cube-mysql` only when `mysql.enabled=true` and `mysql.host` is empty.
Set `mysql.host` to use an existing MySQL service; the chart will not install `cube-mysql`.

The chart installs `cube-redis` only when `redis.enabled=true` and `redis.host` is empty.
Set `redis.host` to use an existing Redis service; the chart will not install `cube-redis`.

## CubeMaster configuration

The `cube-master` image uses `CubeMaster/docker/Dockerfile` directly and does not carry a Kubernetes-specific entrypoint or bundled `conf.yaml`.
The chart stores the One-click `CubeMaster/conf.yaml` at `deploy/k8s/chart/files/cube-master/conf.yaml`, renders MySQL/Redis values into it, creates a release-scoped Secret named `<release>-master-config`, and mounts it to `/usr/local/services/cubemaster/conf.yaml`; `CUBE_MASTER_CONFIG_PATH` points CubeMaster to that mounted file.

CubeMaster artifact storage maps to `/data/CubeMaster/storage`, matching one-click.
The chart uses PVC-backed persistence by default so state can survive
rescheduling across dedicated control nodes:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  master:
    persistence:
      enabled: true
      hostPath: ""
      storageClassName: cube-cbs-wffc
mysql:
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    hostPath: ""
    storageClassName: cube-cbs-wffc
redis:
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    hostPath: ""
    storageClassName: cube-cbs-wffc
```

Set `storageClassName` / `size` to tune dynamic PVCs, or `existingClaim` to
bind pre-created volumes. Use `hostPath` only for single-node throwaway
environments; multi-control-node deployments must use PVCs or external
MySQL/Redis.

The default `cube-cbs-wffc` StorageClass uses `WaitForFirstConsumer`, which is
important on TKE multi-zone clusters: CBS disks are provisioned in the same zone
as the selected control node instead of being created in a random zone before
the Pod is scheduled.

## Database migration

The chart does not deliver a separate DB migration Job or image. CubeMaster owns MySQL schema migration and runs its embedded `CubeMaster/pkg/base/dao/migrate/migrations/mysql` migrations during startup.

- CubeMaster uses the configured MySQL endpoint, user, password, and database.
- The chart does not package or maintain SQL files under `files/`; do not add migration SQL copies to the chart.
- CubeMaster records applied versions in `goose_db_version` and serializes concurrent migration attempts through the migration lock implemented by CubeMaster.
- There is no chart-managed SQL data seed, and the one-click single-node seed file `sql/002_seed_single_node.sql` is intentionally not rendered by the chart. Node registration must come from real Cube Node Pods selected by `placement.compute.nodeSelector`.
- When using third-party MySQL, set `mysql.host` and ensure the configured MySQL user can create/alter tables in `mysql.database`.

## cubemastercli operational CLI

`cubemastercli.enabled=true` installs a chart-managed
`<release>-cubemastercli` Deployment. The image contains the real
`CubeMaster/bin/cubemastercli` binary only; it does not provide a wrapper or
fake `ctl` command.

The chart injects `CUBEMASTERCLI_ADDRESS` and `CUBEMASTERCLI_PORT` from the
current CubeMaster endpoint. Because upstream `cubemastercli` does not read
environment variables as flag defaults, commands should pass those values to
the real binary:

```bash
kubectl exec -n cube-system deploy/cube-cubemastercli -- cubemastercli --help
kubectl exec -n cube-system deploy/cube-cubemastercli -- \
  sh -lc 'cubemastercli --address "$CUBEMASTERCLI_ADDRESS" --port "$CUBEMASTERCLI_PORT" node list'
kubectl exec -n cube-system deploy/cube-cubemastercli -- \
  sh -lc 'cubemastercli --address "$CUBEMASTERCLI_ADDRESS" --port "$CUBEMASTERCLI_PORT" template list'
```

The `cubemastercli` image is intentionally independent from `cube-master` and
`cube-node`. It contains CLI/operator tooling only; the runtime images do not
carry this operational entry point.

## Cube Proxy Node

`cube-proxy-node` is a Cube data-plane component. It is enabled by default to match one-click behavior and is installed, upgraded, and uninstalled with the Cube release instead of being left as an unmanaged DaemonSet.

The default TLS mode is `selfSigned`, matching the one-click mkcert-style test experience. Production environments should provide a real TLS certificate and reserve node host ports 80/443 on selected nodes. The image reuses `CubeProxy/Dockerfile`; the chart does not override nginx with a Kubernetes-only configuration.

`cube-proxy-node` also starts the built-in `cube-proxy-sidecar`. The chart wires the sidecar to the chart-managed or third-party Redis endpoint and to the CubeMaster Kubernetes Service. Do not run a separate unmanaged CubeProxy sidecar.

### Production TLS Secret

```yaml
cubeProxy:
  enabled: true
  domain: sandbox.example.com
  tls:
    mode: existingSecret
    existingSecret: cube-proxy-certs
    certSecretKey: tls.crt
    keySecretKey: tls.key
```

The Secret keys are mounted to the file names required by the `CubeProxy` image:

- `cube.app+3.pem`
- `cube.app+3-key.pem`

The certificate SAN should cover the sandbox domain used by CubeAPI, typically:

```text
sandbox.example.com
*.sandbox.example.com
```

Keep `controlPlane.api.sandboxDomain` and `cubeProxy.domain` consistent. Configure DNS so the domain and wildcard subdomains resolve to the CubeProxy entrypoint.

### cert-manager TLS

When cert-manager is installed in the cluster, let the chart create a `Certificate`:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  api:
    sandboxDomain: sandbox.example.com
cubeProxy:
  enabled: true
  domain: sandbox.example.com
  tls:
    mode: certManager
    certManager:
      issuerRef:
        kind: ClusterIssuer
        name: letsencrypt-prod
      dnsNames:
        - sandbox.example.com
        - "*.sandbox.example.com"
```

Wildcard public certificates usually require a DNS-01 issuer.

### Self-signed TLS for test only

For offline test environments, explicitly opt in to a chart-generated self-signed certificate:

```yaml
cubeProxy:
  enabled: true
  domain: cube.app
  tls:
    mode: selfSigned
    selfSigned:
      dnsNames:
        - cube.app
        - "*.cube.app"
        - localhost
      ipAddresses:
        - 127.0.0.1
```

This mode creates a release-scoped Secret with `tls.crt`, `tls.key`, and `ca.crt`. Import `ca.crt` into clients if browser or SDK trust is required. Do not use this mode for production.

`cube-proxy-node` uses `placement.compute`, so proxy Pods run on the same
dedicated compute node pool as Cube Node Pods. The chart does not create node
labels.

`cubeProxy.hostNetwork=true` is also the default. This is required for one-click
parity: CubeProxy must terminate `cube.app` / wildcard traffic on a node-local
host-network endpoint and directly reach local sandbox bridge IPs such as
`192.168.0.x:<port>`. The chart patches the image's default nginx listeners to
the configured `cubeProxy.ports.*.containerPort` values, which default to `80`
and `443`.

The chart does not create a `cube-proxy-node` ClusterIP Service. A normal
Kubernetes Service load-balances requests across proxy Pods, which does not
match the one-click model where callers reach an explicit CubeProxy host
endpoint. For sandbox data-plane traffic, point wildcard DNS at a specific
CubeProxy node IP or at an external load balancer that preserves the intended
CubeProxy topology.

CubeProxy admin health remains loopback-only inside each Pod, matching the image's nginx admin listener. The chart validates it through Pod readiness/liveness probes rather than exposing it through a Service.

CubeProxy reads sandbox routing metadata from Redis in nginx Lua. Because nginx
does not automatically inherit Kubernetes DNS resolution for Lua cosocket
connections, the chart renders an nginx `resolver` into
`/usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf/global/global.conf`. By default the proxy
discovers resolver addresses from the Pod `/etc/resolv.conf`, which resolves the
chart-managed `cube-redis.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local` Service name and
third-party Redis DNS names. Override only when the cluster requires explicit
DNS servers:

```yaml
cubeProxy:
  resolver:
    addresses:
      - 172.18.0.10
    valid: 30s
    timeout: 5s
    ipv6: false
```

## Cube DNS

`cubeDns.enabled=true` delivers CoreDNS for one-click style sandbox domain
resolution. The default `cubeDns.mode=nodeLocal` runs `cube-dns` as a
hostNetwork DaemonSet on Cube compute nodes selected by `placement.compute`
and listens on `127.0.0.54:53`.
`cube-node` Pods use `dnsPolicy: None` and explicitly set
`dnsConfig.nameservers: [127.0.0.54]`, so `cube.app` and wildcard domains are
resolved inside the Big Pod without modifying host-wide DNS.

Sandbox guest DNS is configured separately from the `cube-node` Pod DNS. The
guest cannot use `127.0.0.54` because that address is the guest loopback inside
the sandbox. By default `cubeDns.sandboxGateway.enabled=true` also binds
node-local `cube-dns` on the compute node HostIP, and
`cubeNode.dns.sandbox.useCubeDns=true` injects that HostIP into Cubelet
`default_dns_servers`.

CubeVS eBPF egress does not traverse host kube-proxy ClusterIP DNAT, so guests
should not access Kubernetes Service ClusterIPs directly. For Services that
must be reached by sandbox DNS name, configure a node-local HTTP proxy and
matching DNS overrides:

```yaml
cubeDns:
  sandboxGateway:
    enabled: true

cubeNode:
  dns:
    sandbox:
      useCubeDns: true
  sandboxServiceProxy:
    dedicated:
      enabled: true
      nodeName: 10.2.36.21
      answerIPs:
        - 10.2.36.21
      dns:
        enabled: true
  sandboxServiceProxies:
    - name: agent-way-model-gateway
      listenPort: 4000
      upstreamHost: agent-way-model-gateway.agent-infra.svc.cluster.local
      upstreamPort: 4000
      upstreamResolver: 172.19.166.188
      upstreamHostHeader: agent-way-model-gateway.agent-infra.svc.cluster.local
      answerIPs:
        - 10.2.36.21
      dnsNames:
        - agent-way-model-gateway.agent-infra
        - agent-way-model-gateway.agent-infra.svc.cluster.local
```

With this configuration, `cube-dns` returns the dedicated proxy IP for the
listed names, and the proxy connects to the Kubernetes Service from the node
network namespace. Set `upstreamResolver` to the cluster DNS Service IP when
`dnsNames` includes the same FQDN as `upstreamHost`, otherwise the proxy can
resolve its own upstream back to the node-local override.

The sandbox network policy must allow both the dedicated proxy IP and the
dedicated DNS IP used as the guest nameserver.

Set `cubeDns.answerIP` to return a fixed A record. If it is empty in node-local
mode, `cube-dns` returns the current node HostIP. Optional `cubeDns.mode=service`
keeps the older ClusterIP DNS model, where callers must explicitly point their
DNS policy or upstream DNS to the `cube-dns` Service. In service mode, set
`cubeDns.answerIP` to an explicit CubeProxy entrypoint.

The chart does not silently rewrite Kubernetes nodes' host DNS settings.
For external clients, browsers, SDKs, or any Pod that is not explicitly using this `dnsConfig`, configure DNS/LB/Ingress outside the chart so `cubeProxy.domain` and wildcard subdomains resolve to an explicit CubeProxy node or external load balancer.

## WebUI

`webui.enabled=true` delivers the one-click WebUI by default:

- `cube-webui` image packages one-click `webui/dist` static assets;
- a chart-rendered nginx config proxies `/cubeapi/` to the CubeAPI Service;
- the Service listens on port `12088`, matching one-click `WEB_UI_HOST_PORT`.

Expose the WebUI externally by changing `webui.service.type` or by adding your platform's ingress/load balancer configuration.

## Diagnostics

One-click delivers `cube-diag` scripts on the host. The Kubernetes chart delivers the equivalent operational entry point as a ConfigMap when `diagnostics.enabled=true`:

```bash
kubectl get configmap -n cube-system cube-diagnostics -o jsonpath='{.data.cube-diag-k8s\.sh}' > /tmp/cube-diag-k8s.sh
sh /tmp/cube-diag-k8s.sh cube-system cube
```

The script collects Pods, DaemonSets, Deployments, Services, Endpoints, Events, Helm values/manifests, Pod descriptions, and recent logs for Cube components into a timestamped directory.

## CubeEgress

`cubeEgress.enabled=true` runs CubeEgress inside the Cube Node Big Pod:

- `cube-egress` mounts `/etc/cube/ca` and exposes the loopback admin API on `127.0.0.1:9090`;
- `cube-egress-net` waits for the `cube-dev` interface, applies the upstream `CubeEgress/scripts/cube-proxy-iptables-init.sh` rules, periodically reapplies them, and removes them on Pod termination;
- CubeMaster and CubeAPI both mount the same CA Secret at `/etc/cube/ca` so template CA bake and AgentHub/OpenClaw CA injection use the same trust root.

Default CA mode is `selfSigned`; the chart creates and reuses a release-scoped Secret named `<release>-egress-ca` with:

```text
cube-root-ca.crt
cube-root-ca.key
placeholder.crt
placeholder.key
```

For production CA lifecycle control, pre-create a Secret and use:

```yaml
cubeEgress:
  enabled: true
  ca:
    mode: existingSecret
    existingSecret: cube-egress-ca
```

Do not rotate the CubeEgress CA casually: templates baked with the old CA and sandboxes trusting the old CA must be considered during rotation.

## Render and lint

```bash
helm lint ./deploy/k8s/chart
helm template cube ./deploy/k8s/chart -n cube-system > /tmp/cube-rendered.yaml
```

## Verify

```bash
kubectl get pods -n cube-system -o wide
kubectl get ds -n cube-system cube-node
kubectl logs -n cube-system -l app.kubernetes.io/component=cube-node -c pvm-host-bootstrap --tail=100
kubectl logs -n cube-system -l app.kubernetes.io/component=cube-node -c cube-node-init --tail=100
kubectl logs -n cube-system -l app.kubernetes.io/component=cube-node -c cube-node --tail=100
kubectl logs -n cube-system deploy/cube-master -c cube-master --tail=100
kubectl exec -n cube-system deploy/cube-cubemastercli -- \
  sh -lc 'cubemastercli --address "$CUBEMASTERCLI_ADDRESS" --port "$CUBEMASTERCLI_PORT" node list'
helm test cube -n cube-system --timeout 20m
```

## Upgrade policy

`cubeNode.updateStrategy.type` defaults to `RollingUpdate`. For production
maintenance windows, set it to `OnDelete` if you need to upgrade one compute
node at a time after draining or cleaning Cube sandboxes on that node.

## Rollback warning

Helm rollback only rolls back Kubernetes resources. It does not undo host kernel, GRUB, udev, fstab, or XFS changes made by the bootstrap Init Containers.
Prepare a separate host-kernel rollback runbook for production.

## Uninstall cleanup

`helm uninstall cube -n cube-system` removes chart-managed Kubernetes resources, including CubeProxy, CubeDNS, WebUI, CubeEgress, MySQL/Redis when they are chart-managed, and diagnostic ConfigMaps. It intentionally does not remove:

- operator-provided node labels/taints;
- external MySQL/Redis resources;
- hostPath data such as `/data/CubeMaster/storage`, `/data/cubelet`, `/data/cube-shim`, `/data/snapshot_pack`, and logs;
- host kernel, GRUB, udev, fstab, or XFS changes made by bootstrap containers;
- external DNS or load balancer records.

Clean those items using the platform runbook for the target environment.
